00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to this first lesson in Maya, where we're going

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to cover the interface. It's the first thing you see

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
when you open Maya. It's good to get familiarized with it.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
As you go through this course, you will become more

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and more familiar with it, and comfortable using it.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But it's a great place to start, just that we know

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
what we're looking at because it's easy to get intimidated

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when you're first starting to learn 3D. I know I was

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
when I opened up a program and you see all these buttons

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and all these menus, and you have no idea what's important

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and what's not. It just looks like some crazy alien interface,

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and where to even begin with that. That's why I have this lesson.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
copywriter. These accomplishments include becoming the number

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
one health and wellness copywriter on Google, being featured

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in a case study interview with top copywriter

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Jacob McMillan. And receiving awesome feedback like

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this one from none other than Craig Clemens, who has generated more than

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
1 billion dollars in sales through the art of copywriting.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But you might be thinking, what would I actually learn

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in this course? Well, for starters, you'll

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
get access to over 60 lessons, each one to ten minutes

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to make them simpler, more memorable and hopefully

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
more motivating to spur you into action. The lessons

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
will cover copywriting essentials, like

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
writing catchy headlines. The six pillars of persuasion,

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
psychological triggers, how to find your clients,

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
as well as copywriting productivity hacks, the

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
best SEO practices, power words, career development,

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and five story structures you can use

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
if you run out of ideas. So with all this

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in mind, let me ask you, are you ready to give it a try?

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If so, fantastic. Let's move on from this introduction

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and get started with the first lesson. See you soon.
