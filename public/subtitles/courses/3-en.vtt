00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to Maya 3D Animation Course 3

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.000
In this lesson, we'll dive deeper into Maya's animation tools

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm Lucas Ridley, and I'll be your instructor for this journey

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
We'll explore intermediate animation techniques

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Including keyframe animation and timing principles

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's start by opening Maya and setting up our workspace

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
First, we'll create a new scene for our animation project

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
Understanding the timeline is crucial for animation

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
We'll learn how to set keyframes effectively

10
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000
Animation curves will help us control motion smoothly
