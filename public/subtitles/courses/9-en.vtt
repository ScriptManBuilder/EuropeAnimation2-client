00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to Maya 3D Animation Course 9

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.000
This course focuses on modeling for animation

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm Lucas Ridley, your Maya modeling instructor

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
We'll create characters and props for animation

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Polygon modeling provides precise control

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Edge flow is crucial for deformation

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Topology determines how well characters animate

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
We'll model with animation constraints in mind

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
UV mapping prepares models for texturing

10
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000
Clean geometry ensures smooth animation
