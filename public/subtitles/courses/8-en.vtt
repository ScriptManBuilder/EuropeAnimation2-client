00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to Maya 3D Animation Course 8

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.000
This course covers dynamics and simulation systems

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm Lucas Ridley, your Maya dynamics instructor

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
We'll explore cloth, hair, and fluid simulations

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
nCloth provides realistic fabric behavior

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
nHair creates dynamic hair and fur systems

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Fluid effects simulate water, smoke, and fire

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
Particle systems create complex visual effects

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
Collision detection makes simulations realistic

10
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000
These tools are essential for modern 3D production
