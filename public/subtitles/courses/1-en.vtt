Hi and welcome to this course, Maya for beginners animation.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is the fourth in a series of courses I'm teaching about Maya.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You are totally welcome to start with this course.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You'll have all the scene files you'll need to follow along.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My name is Lucas Ridley and I've been a professional animator

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
for over eight years, animating characters like the hog riders

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in Clash of Clans to all different types of Lego characters

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to feature films like Michael Bay's Transformers,

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One, and the most recent

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Avengers Infinity War. This is the kind of experience

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
you're going to be learning from in this course on animation.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This course has over four hours of training in animation,

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so by the end of it, you're going to have a really good grasp

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
of how to animate, especially inside of Autodesk Maya.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There's many principles we're going to cover in animation

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that would apply to any software. We're going to use

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the industry standard Autodesk Maya that I've used

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
at every studio I've ever worked at.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This course is going to be broken up into four different

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
exercises that will get progressively more complex.

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I hope you'll join me in this course and learn animation

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and Autodesk Maya. Thanks for watching.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Maya is a software created by Autodesk. You can go

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to autodesk.com/free-trials to get a free trial of Maya.

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If you're a student and you can prove that through
their criteria, you can get a full version of Maya

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
for one year for free. The next best option is the Indie license,

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which you can get at makeanything.autodesk.com/maya-indie.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The Indie license is celebrated by the Maya community

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
because it is so much cheaper than other licenses.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Maya Indie has no restrictions except for how much money

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
you can make. It's roughly $250 per year for a full

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
version of Maya with no lack of features.
and get started with the first lesson. See you soon.
